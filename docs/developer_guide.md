## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PowerShell (for automation scripts)
- Git (for version control)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-report-integration.git
   cd product-report-integration
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   Use pip to install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Settings**
   Update the `src/config/settings.json` and `src/config/connections.json` files with your specific configurations.

4. **Run Initial Tests**
   Ensure everything is set up correctly by running the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/python
   ```

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all public classes and methods.
- Ensure PowerShell scripts are well-commented for clarity.

## Testing
- Unit tests are located in the `tests/python` and `tests/powershell` directories.
- Use `pytest` for running Python tests.
- For PowerShell scripts, use Pester for testing.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. **Branching**
   - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

2. **Commit Changes**
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.

3. **Push Changes**
   - Push your branch to the repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Open a pull request for review.

## Debugging and Feature Enhancement
- Use logging to track the flow of the application. The Logger class in `src/python/utils/logger.py` can be utilized for this purpose.
- For debugging, consider using breakpoints and step-through debugging in your IDE.
- Document any new features or changes made to the codebase in this guide to keep it up to date.
