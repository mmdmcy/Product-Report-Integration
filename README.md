# Product Report Integration System

## Overview
The Product Report Integration System is designed to centralize the generation, management, and distribution of product reports. This system integrates Python and PowerShell scripts to automate data collection, processing, and reporting, ensuring efficient communication with stakeholders. It serves as a unified platform where different teams can access tailored information without requiring repetitive manual reporting efforts.

## What This Project Is
The Product Report Integration System is a comprehensive solution for organizations that need to track, analyze, and report on product metrics across multiple dimensions. It addresses the challenge of conveying different aspects of product information to various stakeholders by creating a centralized reporting framework. The system is particularly valuable for engineering teams that need to communicate complex technical information to diverse audiences.

## Technologies Included
- Python 3.8+ for core data processing and report generation
- PowerShell 5.1+ for automation and scheduling
- Jinja2-style templating for report customization
- JSON for configuration and data storage
- HTML/CSS for interactive dashboards
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- CSV for data export compatibility with other tools
- APIs for external system integration

## What It Does
The system performs several key functions:
- Collects data from multiple sources including databases, APIs, and files
- Cleans and transforms raw data into standardized formats
- Processes metrics according to customizable business rules
- Generates reports using configurable templates
- Creates visualizations to highlight important trends and issues
- Distributes reports to the appropriate stakeholders
- Monitors system performance and security metrics
- Provides interactive dashboards for real-time data exploration

## Features
- Report Generation: Create and save product reports using customizable templates.
- Data Processing: Clean and transform data from various sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- API Integration: Fetch and post data to external APIs for seamless data management.
- Automation: Schedule tasks and automate deployment processes using PowerShell scripts.
- Stakeholder Notifications: Alert stakeholders about report availability and updates.

## What It Can Be Used For
- Product Performance Monitoring: Track KPIs across product lines and versions
- Quality Assurance: Monitor defect rates and resolution times
- Security Compliance: Generate reports on security posture and vulnerabilities
- Engineering Process Improvement: Measure and report on development metrics
- Stakeholder Communication: Create tailored reports for different departments including management, engineering, and sales
- Resource Planning: Analyze system resource utilization and forecast needs
- Customer Support: Track support metrics and identify common issues

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd product-report-integration
   ```

2. Install Python Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure Settings:
   Update the `src/config/settings.json` and `src/config/connections.json` files with your specific configurations.

4. Run PowerShell Scripts:
   Use the provided PowerShell scripts in the `src/powershell` directory to automate tasks and manage data collection.

## How To Use It

### Basic Usage
1. Create report templates in the templates directory
2. Configure data sources in the connections.json file
3. Run data collection scripts to gather information
4. Generate reports using the report_generator module
5. View reports and dashboards in the output directory

### Specific Examples

#### Generate a Basic Report
```python
from src.python.report_generator.generator import ReportGenerator
from src.python.report_generator.templates import ReportTemplate

# Create and load a template
template = ReportTemplate("default_template")
template.load_template("templates/default_template.txt")

# Prepare your data
data = {"title": "My Report", "content": "This is a test report"}

# Generate the report
generator = ReportGenerator(template, data)
report_content = generator.generate_report()
generator.save_report(report_content, "output/my_report.txt")
```

#### Create a Security Dashboard
```
python create_security_dashboard.py
```

#### Process Multiple Data Sources
```
python data_processing_example.py
```

#### Schedule Automated Reports
```powershell
.\src\powershell\automation\schedule_tasks.ps1
```

## Usage Guidelines
- To generate a report, utilize the `ReportGenerator` class from the `report_generator` module.
- For data processing, leverage the `DataCleaner` and `DataTransformer` classes.
- Use the `APIClient` class for any API interactions.
- Schedule tasks using the `schedule_tasks.ps1` script.
- Generated reports are saved to the `output/` directory in the project root (created automatically on first run).
